Before using BPBAac tool, please ensure following softwares have been downloaded and successfully installed in your computer:
(1)R
(2)Perl
(3)SVM R package 'e1071'
Imput protein sequence file must be FASTA format. Each sequence should contain the start codon for methionine.


In current directory, run following command:

perl DataPrepare.pl FASTA_FILE_NAME 
Rscript BPBAacPre.R

Now, a file named "FinalResult.csv" is generated, which can be opened with Excel softwares.

The default SVM cutoff value for decision is set as 0.5. You can change the value in the last command of "BPBAacPre.R" script.
A web-based online prediction server is now under development: http://biocompute.bio.cuhk.edu.hk/BPBAac/.
