bioentry -> contains the contigs of the query taxons (one row for each contig, taxon_id tells which go together)
biosequences -> contains the sequences of the bioentries
taxon and taxon_name -> more info about the taxons

pfam_table -> defines protein families
pfam_hits -> tells which protein family was found at which position in which sequence (hash)


seq_feature -> tells which sequence features (term) are found on which bioentry.
location -> start and end position of a seq_feature. Some sequence features have several locations.
term -> defines the terms found in the seq_feature table
seqfeature_qualifier_value -> defines the value of the sequence feature


og_hits -> seq_id to orthogroup

sequence_hash_dictionnary -> links a seqid (sequence_feature_id) with a sequence hash


reference -> papers
